                <b>Hi there, I am Louise.</b>
                I’m an artist and storyteller who thrives on carving out the paths of characters in their worlds.
                Storytelling is my driving force. It's something that brings me to life every day.
                The intricate challenges of worldbuilding and character design push me in the best way possible,
                and once I dive into a project, it’s hard to pull me away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up with osteogenesis imperfecta, 
                a rare genetic disorder that limited my ability to participate in many physical activities, 
                I found myself diving deeply into my imagination. I created my own worlds and characters, 
                and that first feeling of true passion shaped my dedication and my love for exploring the limitless possibilities of 
                creative expression soon followed. 
                While I’m always eager to experiment with new mediums,
                illustration remains my true expertise with 7 years of digital art under my belt. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently studying visual design at LUCA School of Arts in Ghent, Belgium.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m inspired by gothic fantasy and love blending the cute and the creepy from time to time. Exploring fantasy, 
                crafting intricate narratives, and even collecting trinkets fuel my imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to explore my portfolio and contact me if you’d like to work together with this creative centipede to bring your vision to life.
